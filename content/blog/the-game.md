being able to send a boulder outside requires a certain sense of clutchness. like you're the last man standing in a game of search and destroy in call of duty and you're defending, up against a full team who has just planted the bomb. in the past, i'd often toss a grenade at the ground and surrender, and the classmates i would be playing with would be like "awwww brandon, just try! you never know." or how in tennis when my coach put me in number 2 singles on the varsity team one tournament just to test things out and i went up 6-1, 4-0 or something against the kid and my coach was like "wow brandon, keep up the good work" and i would end up choking, losing the set and then the third set super tiebreaker. you gotta be able to perform in that state of added pressure, as you're nearing the end of the climb and topping out.
