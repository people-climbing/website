# Welcome to peopleclimbing.com

Thanks for stopping by! This site is a nostalgic journey back to the PlayStation 2 era, reimagined as an interactive 3D web experience.

## What is this place?

peopleclimbing.com is an experimental website that combines the aesthetic of PS2 system menus with modern web technologies. Each 3D object in the grid represents a different video or piece of content, creating an interactive gallery that feels like navigating a game console menu.

## The Tech Behind It

Built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and Three.js, this site pushes the boundaries of what's possible with static web pages. The starfield background, bloom effects, and rotating 3D models all run smoothly in your browser, no plugins required.

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing more about the development process, the models used, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stories about building this nostalgic digital space. Stay tuned!
